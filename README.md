# Simple Python Echo Server & Client

This project demonstrates a basic TCP echo server and client using Python's built-in `socket` module.

## Features
- Accepts one client connection at a time.
- Echoes back any message sent by the client.
- Gracefully closes when the client types `exit`.

# How to Run

## 1. Start the Server

  `python3 server.py`

  ## 2. Start the Client in another terminal 

  `python3 client.py`
